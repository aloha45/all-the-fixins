# all-the-fixins

Come on in guys! All-the-fixins is a Survivor fan page tracking seasons, players, and fans letting users message each other to discuss the game they love! The Survivor Database API is constantly expanding to render more and more information about the 40 seasons of Survivor(US).

I started watching Survivor in 2018 as background noise while I worked on other projects. About halfway through The Austrailian Outback, I was hooked and I binged the whole series in a year and a half. Some seasons I have seen multiple times, and I love the characters so much: the strategy and the way that the personality of each season changes, and how the meta of the game of Survivor constantly gets analyzed and then shaken up. Putting information into the API was exhaustive and took three nights, but I never got tired of it because I love the show.

# Moving Forward

There are a number of goals for expansion of the application: 

- Expand API database to include player information on the scope that season information exists.
- Expand API database to include location information. Add in a map of the world, with countries that can be clicked on to render information about seasons played in the country. Fiji, the Phillipines, Nicaragua, Samoa, and others have been used multiple times!
- Enable more mobility within the website to make it less nav-bar reliant for navigation.
